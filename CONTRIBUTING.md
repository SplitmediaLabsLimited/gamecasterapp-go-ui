# Contributing

Hi! We're looking for some help, and we're excited that you're interested!
We want contributing to this project to be enjoyable and productive for everyone.
All contributions are welcome, including opening and commenting on issues and pull requests, adding or updating the docs,
bug fixes, blog posts, and suggestions for new features.
We follow a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), so please be kind to others and reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

GO-UI is still in an early stage and things will likely move quickly.
The time to review a pull request depends on the complexity involved,
so please be patient if a particular feature takes longer to review than others.

## Local Development

This repo uses [Yarn Workspaces][] and [Lerna][] to develop multiple packages together as a monorepo.
Be sure to install [Yarn][] before setting up the development environment.

Install dependencies and link local packages in the root directory:

```sh
yarn
```

After yarn has linked packages and installed dependencies in the repo you can run the docs in the workspace with this command:

```sh
yarn workspace @go-ui/docs storybook
```

You may want to run on `watch` mode for the rest of the packages so that packages are compiled as you work on.

```sh
yarn lerna run watch --parallel
``` 

## Tests

Unit tests are run with [Jest][], and each package should include a `test/` directory with unit tests for that package.

Running tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

Running tests in watch mode:

```sh
yarn test --watch
```

## Pull Requests

When opening a pull request, please be sure to update any relevant documentation in the READMEs or in the `packages/docs` directory.
Also include a high-level list of changes in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file at the top under the `## Unreleased` heading.
